# University Recommendation System

## Overview
The University Recommendation System is designed to help prospective students in Pakistan find universities that match their interests and preferences. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this system provides personalized recommendations to facilitate informed decision-making for higher education.

## Problem Statement
Students in Pakistan often face challenges in selecting suitable universities due to the vast amount of information and lack of personalized guidance. This project aims to address these challenges by offering a tool that streamlines the university selection process.

## Significance
The recommendation system simplifies the university selection process, enhancing the educational experience and career prospects for Pakistani students.

## Scope
1. Aggregate and process university data.
2. Tailor recommendations to Pakistani students.
3. Handle data quality and availability issues.
4. Provide a user-friendly interface.

## Dataset
### Source
- Public repositories such as Kaggle and UCI.
- Primary dataset: "All The Universities of Pakistan" from Kaggle.

## Approach
### NLP Techniques
1. Text Preprocessing
2. Text Vectorization
3. Similarity Measures

### Algorithms
1. **BERT:** For generating text embeddings.
2. **Cosine Similarity:** For measuring relevance between user interests and university descriptions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
2. **NLP Processing**
3. **Similarity Computation**
4. **Recommendation System Development**
5. **User Interface Design**
6. **Evaluation and Testing**
7. **Deployment**
